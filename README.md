# Osiris Framework

## What is this?

This is a simulation framework that uses OpenGL to render 3D graphics. 

## How to use

### Dependencies

- Freeglut
- Freetype
- GLM
- GLSDK

All the dependencies are included as compressed files in the Osiris/ directory. Just unpack these files in the same directory.

### Build

There is a VS2015 solution file on the Osiris/ directory. This solution builds the dependencies (if they are unpacked), OsirisSDK (the framework itself as a DLL) and the OsirisDemo application.

Building process for MacOS and Linux are unavailable at the moment.
