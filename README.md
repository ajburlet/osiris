# Osiris Graphics Framework

## What is this?

I created this project to study OpenGL and try some game engine concepts I have in mind. For now, the current version 
is able to do simple rendering (0.1).

## Why Osiris?

Usually I like to select the names of random characters of TV shows that I like as codenames for my personal projects. 
In this case, besides being the nae of an egyptian god, Osiris was also the name of a Goa'uld System Lord on the Stargate 
SG1 series.
